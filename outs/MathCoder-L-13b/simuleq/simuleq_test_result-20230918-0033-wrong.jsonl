First, we need to determine how many ounces of the 24.9% copper alloy is required to make 100 ounces of the desired alloy.\n2. Once we have that information, we can then determine how many ounces of the 20% alloy and the 27% alloy are required to make the 100 ounces of the desired alloy.\n3. Finally, we'll combine the two alloys in the required ratio to get the desired alloy.\n\nLet's start with the first step.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the amount of 24.9% alloy for 100 ounces of the desired alloy.\n\nIf Anne and Nancy's alloy is 24.9% copper, then for every 100 ounces of their alloy:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Amount of copper} = 0.249 \\times 100 = 24.9 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\n\nThe remaining 75.1 ounces is the amount of the other metal (since the total alloy is 100% and copper is 24.9%).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the amount of 20% alloy and 27% alloy for 100 ounces of the desired alloy.\n\nLet's denote the amount of 20% alloy as \\( x \\) ounces.\nAnd the amount of 27% alloy as \\( y \\) ounces.\n\nGiven the law of cosines:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 = 100^2\n\\]\n\nBut, we also know that:\n\n\\[\nx + y = \\text{amount of 20% alloy + amount of 27% alloy}\n\\]\n\nGiven the above two equations, we can solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n### Step 3: Combine the two alloys in the required ratio.\n\nOnce we have the amounts of both alloys, we'll mix them in"}, {"role": "text", "content": "the ratio required to get the desired alloy.\n\nLet's start by solving for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) using the given equations."}, {"role": "code", "content": "from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Given equations\neq1 = Eq(x**2 + y**2, 100**2)\neq2 = Eq(x + y, 100)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\nsolution"}, {"role": "execution", "content": "[(0, 100), (100, 0)]"}, {"role": "text", "content": "The solutions for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are either both 0 or both 100.
