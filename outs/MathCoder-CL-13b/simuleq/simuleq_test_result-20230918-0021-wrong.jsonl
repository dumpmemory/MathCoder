This doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as we can't have a negative amount invested. It seems like I made an error in setting up the equation. Let's correct it.\n\nThe interest from the 9% investment would be \\( 0.09 \\times 9000 \\).\n\nThe interest from the 8% investment would be \\( 0.08 \\times x \\).\n\nThe total interest made is $770.

This suggests that there may be another part of the problem that I haven't considered.\n\nLet's go back and re-examine the problem statement. The total amount Walt invested is \\( 9000 + x \\). The total interest he made is $770. The interest from the 9% investment is \\( 0.09 \\times 9000 \\), and the interest from the 8% investment is \\( 0.08 \\times x \\).\n\nThe equation for the total interest should be:\n\n\\[\n0.09 \\times 9000 + 0.08 \\times x = 770\n\\]\n\nThis equation is correct. The value of \\( x \\) should be \\( -500 \\), which doesn't make sense.\n\nUpon further reflection, I realize that the problem might be that the interest rates are not the only factors that affect the total interest. The principal amount invested at each rate is also important.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem. The total amount Walt invested is \\( 9000 + x \\).
