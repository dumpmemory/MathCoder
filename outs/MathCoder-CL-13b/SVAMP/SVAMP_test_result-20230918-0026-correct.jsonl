Finally, we subtract the amount of sugar Mary has already put in from the total amount of sugar called for to find out how many more cups of sugar she needs to add.\n\nThe formula to find out the remaining amount of sugar needed is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining sugar needed} = \\text{Total sugar called for} - \\text{Sugar already put in}\n\\]\n\nLet's proceed with the calculation."}, {"role": "code", "content": "# Given data\ntotal_sugar_called_for = 7  # Total amount of sugar called for in the recipe\nsugar_already_put_in = 4  # Amount of sugar Mary has already put in\n\n# Calculate the remaining amount of sugar needed\nremaining_sugar_needed = total_sugar_called_for - sugar_already_put_in\nremaining_sugar_needed"}, {"role": "execution", "content": "3"}, {"role": "text", "content": "The remaining amount of sugar needed is \\(3\\) cups. \n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{3}\\)."}, {"role": "text", "content": "3"}], "completion": "3"}
