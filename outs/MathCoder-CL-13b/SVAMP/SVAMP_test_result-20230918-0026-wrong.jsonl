Therefore, \\( M \\) would be \\( F - 16 \\), which is -13 inches.\n\nHowever, it doesn't make sense for the mouse to jump a negative height. Let's reconsider the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states that the mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog. If we assume \\( F \\) to be the height the frog jumped, then \\( M \\) would be \\( F - 16 \\).\n\nBut the problem also states that the grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog. This means \\( G \\) is actually 25 inches more than \\( F \\), not 25 inches more than \\( G \\).\n\nLet's correct this and find the heights \\( F \\) and \\( M \\) again."}, {"role": "code", "content": "# Correct the equation for G, assuming G is 25 inches more than F\nG = F + 25\n\n# Calculate the height the mouse jumped using the equation M = F - 16\nM = F - 16\n\nG, M"}, {"role": "execution", "content": "(28, -13)"}], "completion": "(28, -13)", "model_answer": "(28,-13)"}
