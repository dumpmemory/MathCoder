This doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as we can't have a negative amount of candy.\n\nLet's re-evaluate our approach:\n\nGiven:\n1. Cost of the first type of candy = 3.50 dollars/pound\n2. Cost of the second type of candy = 4.30 dollars/pound\n3. Cost of the mixture = 4 dollars/pound\n4. Total pounds of the mixture = 10 pounds\n\nFrom the given information, the total cost of the mixture is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of mixture} = \\text{Cost of first type of candy} \\times X + \\text{Cost of second type of candy} \\times Y\n\\]\n\nGiven that the total cost of the mixture is $40, we can express the equation as:\n\n\\[\n40 = 3.50X + 4.30Y\n\\]\n\nGiven the above equation, we can express \\( Y \\) in terms of \\( X \\) as:\n\n\\[\nY = \\frac{40 - 3.50X}{4.30}\n\\]\n\nHowever, this is the same expression we derived earlier, which doesn't seem to be working out.\n\nLet's try
