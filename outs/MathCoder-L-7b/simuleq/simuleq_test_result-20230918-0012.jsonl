Then:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total capacity of 20-ton bins} = 20x\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the total capacity of the 15-ton bins\n\nThe total capacity of the 15-ton bins can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total capacity of 15-ton bins} = \\text{Number of 15-ton bins} \\times \\text{Capacity of each 15-ton bin}\n\\]\n\nLet's assume that \\( y \\) is the number of 15-ton bins. Then:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total capacity of 15-ton bins} = 15y\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Set up an equation to represent the total capacity of the warehouse\n\nThe total capacity of the warehouse is 510 tons. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n20x + 15y = 510\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solve for the number of each type of bin\n\nWe can solve this system of equations by either substitution or elimination. Here, we'll use the substitution method.\n\n1. Substitute the expression for the total capacity of the 20-ton bins into the equation:\n\n\\[\n"}, {"role": "text", "content": "20x + 15y = 510 \\\\\n20x = 510 - 15y \\\\\nx = \\frac{{510 - 15y}}{20}\n\\]\n\n2. Substitute this expression for \\( x \\) back into the equation:\n\n\\[\n20 \\left( \\frac{{510 - 15y}}{20} \\right) + 15y = 510 \\\\\n100 - 30y + 15y = 510 \\\\\n100 - 30y = 510 - 15y \\\\\n-30y = 160 \\\\\ny = \\frac{{160}}{-30} = 5\n\\]\n\n3. Find the number of 15-ton bins:\n\n\\[\ny = 5 \\\\\nx = \\frac{{510 - 15y}}{20} \\\\\nx = \\frac{{510 - 15 \\times 5}}{20} = \\frac{{510 - 75}}{20} = \\frac{{435}}{20} = 21\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 21 bins that hold 15 tons each, and there are \\( 510 - 75 = 435 \\) tons of grain that are stored in these bins.\n\nTherefore, the number of 20-ton bins is \\( x = 5 \\), and the number of 15-ton bins is \\( y = 5 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]"}, {"role": "text", "content": "5"}], "completion": "5"}
